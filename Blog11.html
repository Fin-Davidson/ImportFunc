Today, I had the opportunity to participate in a Q&A session with Miguel Leal, the co-founder of SOMOS Foods. He shared some incredible insights into building a successful brand, leading a startup, and entrepreneurship in general.

These were my key takeaways:

Building an authentic and unique brand is important.
Miguel emphasised the need of having a solid business plan and selecting a name that resonates both domestically and culturally. He also shared that SOMOS purposefully recruited designers who were experienced in food and beverages, yet new to restaurants, to ensure they could provide a unique perspective.

Start your business with someone you know.
When choosing business partners, Miguel recommended collaborating with people you already know and trust. He found it much simpler to establish a business with his friend, someone who shares his Mexican roots. He also mentioned that starting a business with an existing contact is much easier than having to find business partners.

Hiring the correct people is crucial.
Miguel emphasised that being able to assemble a high-performing, motivated team can make or break a start-up, he looks for individuals who can integrate their academic learnings into real-world situations and who prioritise the company over individual interests.

Being a Co-Founder is full of new challenges.
Transitioning from his past role as a Head of Marketing to leading a company was not without its challenges, Miguel needed to step out of his comfort zone into areas which he had previously stayed away from, such as dealing with public engagements as co-founder.

But...

Being a Co-Founder is also fulfilling!
Miguel said that being an entrepreneur, while challenging, has been immensely rewarding. He advocates for appreciating both the good and bad days, recognising that the entrepreneurial journey is a roller coaster!

A Strong Network is Invaluable.
Finally, Miguel shared advice on network building, emphasizing the importance of maintaining good relationships and handling rejections positively. He feels strongly that a 'no' today can potentially turn into a 'yes' tomorrow, if we treat people with respect and kindness. He thinks that his strong network is one of his key strengths and can give you a competitive advantage in business.

Many thanks to Miguel for taking the time to talk to us!
